**Title**

Iquitos dengue data for the 2000/2001 to 2012/2013 dengue seasons 

**Description**

The dataset contains weekly dengue data for the city of Iquitos, Peru. The dataset includes the following variables:

* **season**: the transmission season
* **season_week**: week of the season (not the calendar year - the season starts following the week with historically lowest dengue cases over the years 2000-2009); 
* **week_start_date**: date of the first day of the week; 
* **denv1_cases**: number of laboratory confirmed cases with DENV1; 
* **denv2_cases**: number of laboratory confirmed cases with DENV2; 
* **denv3_cases**: number of laboratory confirmed cases with DENV3; 
* **denv4_cases**: number of laboratory confirmed cases with DENV4; 
* **other_positive_cases**: laboratory-positive cases without serotype identified (these include acute IgM positive and IgM conversions); 
* **additional_cases**: at times not all specimens submitted were tested due to overload of the capacity for testing or incomplete case information. For those weeks, the number of additional laboratory-positive cases among those not tested was estimated by multiplying the number of untested cases by the rate of laboratory-positive cases amongst those that were tested; 
* **total_cases**: the sum of all cases (denv1-4_cases + additional_cases), the target time series for forecasting.

Over the period of the study, all diagnostic methods were consistent: IgM ELISA (acute and convalescent sample) and serotype-specific RT-PCR (acute sample). Details are presented in Forshey et al. 2010. In 2004, there was a two-week period when surveillance effort was extended to 24 hours a day because of the large volume of cases (Stoddard et al. 2014). Otherwise, patients were enrolled 5-7 hours a day, five days a week.
